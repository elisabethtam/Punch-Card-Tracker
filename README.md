 * Program Name: Mathnasium Punch Card Tracker
 * Context: At Mathnasium, students are tutored in math by completing worksheets, and earning a star for each 
 * worksheet they complete. When Level 1 Students earn 24 stars, a punch card is added to their card count. The 
 * students can cash in their punch cards to earn prizes, with bigger prizes costing more punch cards. The longer
 * a student keeps coming to Mathnasium, the higher of a Level they reach, and the less stars are required to earn
 * a punch card. The punch cards and stars were manually tracked on Google Sheets, and employees had to
 * calculate how many punch cards the students earned based on how many stars they previously had and how many they
 * earned during a session. This program is meant to automate that process and make it easier for employees to
 * track their students' punch cards. 
 * Description: For each student, their name, level, total cards aquired, cards spent, and cards left to spend are 
 * recorded. There are three buttons the employees can use to modify these:
 *  - Add cards: When the students win challenges or win games or displays exemplary work, an instructor can reward them with punch cards.
 *  - Add stars: At the end of a tutoring session, an instructor adds up how many worksheets they completed, and rewards them a corresponding amount of stars. When a student reaches 24 stars, it automatically resets and adds another card to their card count. 
 *  - Use cards: A student can "purchase" a prize using the cards they have earned. Each prize has a designated price in amount of cards, so when a student gets a prize, an instructor will use the corresponding number of cards.
